	<p>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ </p>
	<p>I'm glad you're here.</p>
	<p>My name is Timothy Abwao, and my career goal is to become an expert Data Scientist.</p>
	<p>I spend most of my days brushing up on data analytics, and exploring new ways to distill insights from
		even the messiest of datasets.</p>
	<p>I like discovering how things work, and uncovering why mysterious things happen. This helps in asking the right
		questions, which in turn results in interesting revelations and innovative solutions.
	</p>
	<p>This blog is meant to be a platform to share what I've found out so far. But it also serves as a powerful
		motivation to keep on studying new tools and to practise more.</p>
	<p>I believe that with determination, imagination, faith, and a fairly nice plan; anyone can accomplish their
		dreams.</p>
